'My Barista' Skill is an Alexa Skill to bring some of the best coffee recipes to your home. It can say to you a specific recipe or suggest you one : it will say the ingredients, send the recipe on your smartphone, and here we go! 

> This project is in "alpha" state, which mean it was developed for my personal purposes and I still need to use it a lot more and fix it (e.g. test coverages, french language). It is currently not available on any Alexa Store.
